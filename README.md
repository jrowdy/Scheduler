# Scheduler

Link to application: https://github.com/jrowdy/Scheduler

This application uses HTML, CSS, Materialize, JQuery and JavaScript. This is a planner for the working client that needs to visually see their daily responsibilities. The user will be able to type in details of their day in a timeslot and save by pressing the lock button-- which saves their information in local storage so that the details will stay on the page even after refreshing!
